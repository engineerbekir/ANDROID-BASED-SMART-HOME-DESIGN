# ANDROID-BASED-SMART-HOME-DESIGN
In Android-based smart home design, lighting, air-conditioning, door, curtain and blind control are performed.

In smart home aoutomation project;
1. 8 different electronic elements were used. These;

    Geared DC Motor
    Alarm Control
    LDR
    Humidity and temperature sensor
    PIR Sensor
    Arduino UNO
    Servo Motor
    Bluetooth module
2. Control in the project is automatic lighting, air conditioning, curtain and door control parameters.
3. Serial communication with Arduino was provided by using Bluetooth module with Android software.
4. Learned the use and communication of sensors.
5. The program code was written in the interface of the Arduino program.
6. Android-based interface application was made with the App Inventor platform.
